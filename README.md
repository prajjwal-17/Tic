# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. Players can enter their names and take turns placing 'X' or 'O' marks on a 3x3 board. The game ends when one player wins by getting three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is full and the game ends in a draw.

## Features
